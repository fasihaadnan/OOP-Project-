The **Recipe Organizer & Meal Planner** is a C++ program that lets users store, categorize, and search recipes, as well as generate meal plans based on available ingredients. It follows OOP principles, with classes for recipes, management, and meal planning. Users can search by cuisine, ingredients, or meal type, and file handling ensures data persistence. Additionally, an AI-based recipe generator suggests new recipes based on available ingredients and user preferences. The system can be expanded with features like a grocery list or nutritional analysis.
